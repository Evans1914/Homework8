# Tech Trends & News Dashboard

## 📌 Project Approach  
The **Tech Trends & News Dashboard** is a front-end web application designed to fetch and display **real-time technology news** and **trending GitHub repositories**. The goal of the project is to showcase the integration of a **CSS framework for styling** and **Axios for handling HTTP requests efficiently**.  

The application is structured into three main sections:  

- 📢 **Tech News Section** – Displays the latest technology-related news articles.  
- 🌟 **Trending GitHub Repositories Section** – Lists repositories with the highest number of stars.  
- 📊 **Data Visualization** – Uses a bar chart to represent GitHub repository trends.  

### **Development Process:**  
1️⃣ **Designing the Layout** – Identifying key components and their arrangement.  
2️⃣ **Setting Up the Environment** – Initializing the project with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** files.  
3️⃣ **Styling with a CSS Framework** – Implementing **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive and visually appealing design.  
4️⃣ **API Integration with Axios** – Fetching external data efficiently using HTTP requests.  
5️⃣ **Testing and Refinement** – Ensuring responsiveness, correct data rendering, and error handling.

## 🔗 **Axios Implementation for API Calls**  

### **Why Use Axios?**  
- 📌 **Ease of Use** – Simplifies HTTP requests compared to the native `fetch()` API.  
- 🔄 **Automatic JSON Parsing** – Responses are automatically converted into JavaScript objects.  
- ⚠️ **Error Handling** – Built-in `.catch()` method manages request failures gracefully.  

### **APIs Used:**  
1️⃣ **NewsAPI** – Fetches the latest technology news articles.  
2️⃣ **GitHub API** – Retrieves trending GitHub repositories based on star count.  

### **Axios Implementation Process:**  
- **Fetching Data** – Axios sends **HTTP GET** requests to the external APIs.  
- **Processing the Response** – The returned data is filtered and dynamically displayed in the UI.  
- **Error Handling** – Ensures the application remains functional even if an API request fails.
